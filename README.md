#### Github pages was utilized to publish the data dashboard based on this analysis. The analysis was based on volunteers for research done by Roza. Roza is a biological researcher in a prominent microbiology laboratory. Roza wanted to research if bacteria found in the bellybutton could be utilized to synthesize proteins that taste like beef. Roza created a research study that had many volunteers, all of the volunteers were given an ID number. On the dashboad website, [located here](https://16areeves.github.io/Bellybutton_Biodiversity/), volunteers can look up the bacteria grown from their bellybutton using their unique ID. They're three charts on the page based on the data gathered during the study: a gauge chart, a bar chart, and a bubble chart. The first chart, is how many times a week the volunteer washes their bellybutton. The second chart, is the top 10 bacteria recovered from the volunteer. The last chart at the bottom of the page, is a bubble chart, which displays the bacteria found and their amounts are displayed based on the bubble's size.
